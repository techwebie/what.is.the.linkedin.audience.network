* The LinkedIn Audience Network is the latest enhancement in a series of updated features dating back to before Microsoft acquired the company in December 2016. 
* Over the last two years, LinkedIn has significantly improved its publishing platform, streamlined its mobile and desktop apps, and debuted targeting tools. It hasn’t been a complete overhaul, but it’s definitely been an improvement.
* Although LinkedIn’s critics continue to call its advancements, “playing catch up,” the platform does offer a few advantages over some of the more popular social networkers.
* For example, LinkedIn has fewer spam profiles, less political and sensationalized news, and much less user venting. 
* Its commitment to authenticity and manners are two of the big reasons so many people have been migrating to the platform as their primary professional social network.
* As more and more people use LinkedIn as their digital resume, marketers are eager to use the platform to precisely target audiences. 
* Adding third-party advertising to the platform has been a long-requested feature by many of LinkedIn’s biggest advertisers. Now, Sponsored Content will be more dynamic and show up beyond users’ newsfeeds.
